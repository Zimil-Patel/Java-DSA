# Introduction to JAVA

### Short Definition of JDK (Java Development Kit)

**JDK (Java Development Kit)** is a software development environment used for building Java applications. It includes tools required to write, compile, and run Java programs.

### Components of JDK

1. **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Provides libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.

2. **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Executes Java bytecode and enables Java programs to be platform-independent.

3. **Java Compiler (`javac`)**: Converts Java source code into bytecode (.class files) that can be executed by the JVM.

4. **Java Debugger (`jdb`)**: Helps debug Java programs by providing tools to inspect code during execution.

5. **Java Archive (`jar`) Tool**: Packages Java classes and metadata into JAR files for distribution.

6. **Java Documentation Generator (`javadoc`)**: Generates API documentation from Java source code comments.

This concise description can be used for a GitHub repository to explain the JDK and its components.
