# Introduction to JAVA

## Short Definition of JDK (Java Development Kit)

**JDK (Java Development Kit)** is a software development environment used for building Java applications. It includes tools required to write, compile, and run Java programs.

### Components of JDK

1. **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Provides libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.

2. **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Executes Java bytecode and enables Java programs to be platform-independent.

3. **Java Compiler (`javac`)**: Converts Java source code into bytecode (.class files) that can be executed by the JVM.

4. **Java Debugger (`jdb`)**: Helps debug Java programs by providing tools to inspect code during execution.

5. **Java Archive (`jar`) Tool**: Packages Java classes and metadata into JAR files for distribution.

6. **Java Documentation Generator (`javadoc`)**: Generates API documentation from Java source code comments.

This concise description can be used for a GitHub repository to explain the JDK and its components.

To show how to print output in Java for your GitHub documentation, you can provide an example like this:

## Printing Output in Java

In Java, you can use `System.out.println()` to print text or values to the console. Below is a basic example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Printing a simple message to the console
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");

        // Printing the value of a variable
        int number = 10;
        System.out.println("The number is: " + number);
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Hello, World!
The number is: 10
```

This example can be included in your GitHub README or documentation to explain how to print output in Java.
